## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Preprocessing of raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and data formatting.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualization and statistical analysis to understand key patterns and relationships in the data.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying correlations between housing prices, rental costs, job availability, and wages.
- **Geospatial Analysis:** Mapping and analyzing the spatial distribution of jobs and housing.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Building models to predict housing prices based on job market trends and other factors.
- **Report Generation:** Creating summaries and reports of the findings, including visualizations and key takeaways.

## Dataset

The project utilizes several datasets, including:

1. **Housing Data:** Information on housing prices, rental costs, and availability by region.
2. **Job Market Data:** Data on job availability, wages, and employment rates by industry and region.
3. **Demographic Data:** Population statistics, income levels, and other demographic variables.
4. **Geospatial Data:** Coordinates and boundaries of regions for mapping purposes.

Datasets are sourced from public repositories, government databases, or academic resources. Specific datasets used can be found in the `data/` directory with appropriate attributions.
