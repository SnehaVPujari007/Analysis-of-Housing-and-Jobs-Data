<h1>Analysis of Housing and Jobs </h1>
<h3>Project Overview</h3>
<p>The "Analysis of Housing and Jobs" project aims to explore the relationship between housing availability, affordability, and job opportunities in various regions. By analyzing datasets related to housing prices, rental costs, job market data, and demographic information, the project seeks to uncover trends, correlations, and insights that can inform policy-making, urban planning, and individual decision-making.</p>
